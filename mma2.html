<h1>Two Trunks in One</h1>
<p><i>Dragonball Z Super Saiyan Pixel</i><br> 
<i>1/19/16</i><br>

	I had created a 101 frame Dragonball Z character that’s mixed with two attires of the same person. I used hair from the future Trunks when it was long and his kid form attire(color), which is orange and green. I also used an image from google of goku for the body and I freestyled on the rest. The character I chose was Trunks. The reason for choosing this character was because he’s my most favorable character of the DBZ series. I also chose to do Dragonball Z because I grew up on that show and it was the first anime I watched. Dragonball Z was the reason I got hooked onto anime, thus I decided this is my most important thing to draw, animation-wise. </p><img src="http://i1371.photobucket.com/albums/ag292/ItsJoker20/Devante%20Jordan%20Animation_zps1jqa1yik.gif">
